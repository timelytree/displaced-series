# A New Category of Refugees

Mad Max, Book of Eli, The Day After Tomorrow…what do all these iconic films have in common? The principal characters are all some form of future climate refugee. And the last image is of real ones following hurricane Katrina.
Considering the overwhelming amount of natural disasters that have happened in North America in the last month alone, we wanted to talk about human displacement as not only being a product of war, but also something that happens as a result of changing environments and unstable economies.

Climate refugees are not a group you typically hear about, but the number of which are nonetheless steadily increasing, as islands and coastal cities are flooding, deserts are getting larger and more uninhabitable, some parts of the Earth are literally sinking (think Venice, Louisiana, etc.), and the rebuilding of cities can’t keep up with the amount of hurricanes taking them down again.

So our question is, what do we do? How do we prepare for ~200 million displaced humans by 2050? We don’t know the immediate answers ourselves, but what we have recognized are two major fronts that are currently at work, and sometimes at odds, with one another:

1. Curbing climate change
2. **Planning for its consequences**

In this post we will primarily be looking at the latter.

One of the most important things we found was missing from the discussion on climate refugees, is legally recognizing them as a novel category of human displacement. Currently, those seeking refuge from environmental causes that make their homelands unviable are not protected by international laws, meaning they are not treated in the same way as those displaced by conflict. They are not even recognized as having a real reason to move.

So we ask, why would this be the case? One reason is because we don’t immediately feel the effects of climate change as we do a war. Another, perhaps more revealing reason is because internationally recognizing and protecting climate refugees means that governments would have to _accept_ that the climate is truly changing - which is not something many are ready to admit.

And the irony here is that more often than not, climate change is the source of social and economic unrest we so readily see, both of which ultimately lead to violence, revolution and the same conflict refugees that we’re meeting in our series.

Nevertheless, we came across some brilliant ideas/projects that people are already doing that will prepare us for the future:

1. Legally recognizing ‘climate refugees’ as a novel category of human displacement. This enables immigration policies to accommodate those claiming asylum if their homelands become completely unliveable.
2. Libraries Without Borders, who we’re honoured to have as a partner for the show, created the @ideasbox. A Google-funded, waterproof, earthquake-proof, portable media lab that rolls into essentially any camp and/or devastated area and provides on-site wifi, tablets, the adobe suite, etc.
3. Solar powered school boats in Bangladesh. They act as both school buses and classrooms for kids living in flooded areas of the country.
4. Isle de Jean Charles, Louisiana, received $48 million in one of the first allocations of US federal tax money to resettle an entire community of people who’s town is sinking.

To conclude on a high note, we’re confident that despite all the resistance refugees are currently experiencing, humanity will nonetheless band together and help one another out, no matter what. We’ve already seen it happen with the hundreds of thousands of conflict refugees that have been welcomed into safer countries, the hundreds of thousands of doors that have been opened for those affected by hurricanes, earthquakes and fires in the last month, the vast amount of NGO’s that have helped in the process, the amount of media attention displacement has received, and the myriad of conversations it has started.

One thing we know for a fact, is that human resilience is incredibly powerful and unparalleled in times of need. Because it’s a direct reflection of who we are at our cores - a hyper social species that was built from the tight-nit connections we’ve spent millions of years forming with each other. It is our greatest asset and the single most important, human quality that every one of us shares whether we like it or accept it or not. Now let’s take all the energy we’ve spent building borders and walls to start breaking them. Because imagine what New York would be without Italian food, or Vancouver without sushi, or LA without Poke, or Berlin without Turkish doners - boring.
