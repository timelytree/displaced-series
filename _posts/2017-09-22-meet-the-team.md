Our goal with the show is to break as many borders as possible; be that physical, mental or virtual. and to do this we’ve started with our team. We all come from wildly diverse backgrounds and are ourselves nomads at heart. Currently scattered somewhere between Europe and North America, freedom of movement cuts deep at our cores and is something we’ll spend the rest of their lives advocating for.

**Narina Jabari** is our half Syrian/half Ukrainian bred, Canada-raised, director and host. I’ll be showing you how camp looks like from our perspective. I’ll also be running a film production class with James, our DP, at camp so we can hand over the cameras and let our characters can show us their world in their way.

**James Frei**: our British-born, Barcelona-based, director of photography. He’ll be using the latest in small camera tech to get at the hard to reach places (which are all of them in a refugee camp).

**Nauras Jabari**: he’s a programmer by day and our field producer by night (and also Narina’s twin bro). He’s be on top of all logistics and tech, making sure we’re not stranded and that the hard drives don’t implode. He will also be running a basic code camp and helping our displaced entrepreneurs set up online e-commerce stores while waiting for asylum.

**Jared Raab**: our mighty Canadian executive producer without whom telling this story would not have been possible. He’ll be holding down the fort here in Canada.
