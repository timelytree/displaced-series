We came across the Telus Storyhive Competition and instantly jumped at the opportunity to help fund the pilot. The competition awards 10K to filmmakers for a 10min first episode. This is pretty much the starting point we need to get our feet literally off the ground and to a refugee camp in Greece. Since the competition is voting-based, we’d love your help!

**HOW WE GOT HERE** (we’ll have a stand alone article on this soon):

The story came from a trip James (our cinematographer) and Narina (our director/host) took to the Calais ‘Jungle’ in the summer of 2016. It was one of the largest and most notorious camps in Europe at the time. We really didn’t know what we were doing or what we wanted to say. All we knew was that we wanted to make something that explores the aftermath of civil war, but from a non-depressing point of view.

And so, since we’re both avid travellers (we actually met in a Barcelona hostel), James and I took our backpacks, his car, drove over to Calais from London, and walked into camp to see whats up.

**WHAT WE FOUND**

Passed the barbed wire fence, the armed guards, the seriously menacing French police, and through the outer shantytown, we found an entire thriving microcosm completely hidden from the outside world. We instantly met a tonne of people from all over the globe who have been displaced by either war, poverty, or natural disasters, and who are still some of our greatest friends. Inside there were bars and restaurants, shisha lounges and bakeries, a movie theatre and even a hair salon.

We can both safely say that it was one of the most incredible (and fun believe it or not) experiences of our lives. When we left, we realized what our story is: that despite unparalleled suffering, humans will find a way to not only survive, but thrive, no matter what. We believe that showing the feeling of incredible happiness in incredible sadness is extremely powerful. It’s a feeling that we’re still trying to understand but. It is the heart of this series and what we aim to chase all over the world to find.

**HOW WE DID THAT**

With essentially pocket money, we slept in the back of James’ car, subsisted on apples, cheese and baguettes (thank god the French take their cuisine seriously), snuck into campsites to shower, and waited until dark to park somewhere we weren’t supposed to park. At one point we drove onto a field and were woken up by gunshots because apparently it was duck hunting season..

**WHERE WE’RE AT NOW**

This time around we’ll be spending a month on site, and are aiming to pay for accommodation, showers and to feed our crew properly.

Whether you’re a filmmaker/producer, or activist, refugee, just curious, or got to this page by accident somehow, we want to briefly break down what the 10K will allow us to do:

1. Flights (return): Nauras and Narina from Vancouver, James from Barcelona
2. Car rental/gas: camps are usually quite remote
3. Accommodation: option of hostel, campsite, or airbnb. somewhere with room to sleep and edit footage
4. Food
5. Equipment: because we’re trying to capture a very sensitive and intimate world, we’ll be shooting on two iPhone 8’s. we’ll also be getting lavs, a gimbal, tripod and hard drives. maybe even AR/VR equipment (fingers crossed on that front).

Because this is a huge passion project for all of us, we’re aiming to shoot as much as we can for as little as we can, in order to get the whole series off the ground and be able to pay our crew in the future.

If you have any ideas, questions, concerns, about what we’re doing don’t hesitate to reach out!

And in the meantime, it would mean a lot for your vote on the project :)
