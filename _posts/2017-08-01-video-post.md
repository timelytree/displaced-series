To start over they start by burning their identities. Then, some choose to walk across continents while some swim through oceans. Along the way they hide in cargo boxes, crawl under barbed wire fences, squeeze in between hot railcars, or in the trunks of their smugglers’ cars.

Along the way, the person that helped you over that fence becomes your best friend. Together you will spend an unknown amount of days and nights in the back of a pitch black truck. The guy who gave you cigarettes while you wait in detention becomes your business partner. Together you will cut a deal with the Italian mafia and bribe the French police.

The 6 who you share a 4-person tent with at camp for 10 months become your new family. Together you will help each other out of depression. Together you will also manage to party, to get high, to fall in love with the German girls and to hustle for absolutely everything.

_Displaced_ delves into the lives of those displaced by conflict in their homelands. They’re some of the most intelligent, adaptable and resourceful people living in our generation -  and they’re who we want to meet.

With a focus on how youth are restarting from the ground up, this series is a raw, fresh, highly intimate original documentary series that nose dives into the ins and outs of life in a refugee camp, and humanizes one of the misrepresented and stereotyped groups on the planet.

It explores how those displaced by war, corrupted economies, and devastated environments manage not only to survive their circumstances, but thrive despite them, and what they can teach the rest of us about human resilience. Through the eyes of ordinary people stuck in extraordinary situations, the show thrusts an ambiguous, inanimate and pretty removed group of people into the limelight in a way that no other media outlet really captures.

We are not here to talk politics, race, religion, sex or status. We’re here to go way deeper and begin sifting through the noise of the most covered stories of our generation.

First we’ll tell you who we are and how we got on this crazy ride. Then we’ll take you with us to Greece, where we’ll be filming the first season of the series and showing you a world that no other media outlet ever captures.
