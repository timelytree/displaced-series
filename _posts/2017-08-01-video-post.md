Due to the pharmacokinetics of several active components within St. John’s Wort, it is possible that interactions with concomitant medications such as ciclosporin, digoxin, indinavir, theophylline [10] and warfarin [11] can occur. As well, taking Hypericum with the oral contraceptive pill can cause less of the contraceptive to be metabolized, leading to an “under-dosage” effect, ultimately increasing the chance of pregnancy [12]. The European Scientific Cooperative on Phytotherapy also recommends not using St. John’s Wort if taking anti-cancer medications, blood thinners, antidepressants (ie: SSRIs), anti-HIV agents, cardiovascular medications or immunosuppressants [9].

St. John’s Wort should be ingested as a tea (250mL, 1 cup) or tincture (3mL, ½ tsp) 3 times daily for a minimum of 1 week. To even further increase the effects, combine the tinctures of Valerian Root (3mL, ½ tsp) and St. John’s Wort (3mL, ½ tsp) and ingest 2-3 times per day for 3-6 weeks. If symptoms persist for more than 8 weeks, consult a physician [9].

Consisting of 490 species [1], the name “St. John’s Wort” can be used to refer to any of them. Hypericum perforatum is the species most commonly used – aptly named “common St. John’s Wort” – for its ability to treat mild-to-moderate depression [2, 3, 4, 5, 11] and anxiety [6] and has a mild lemony taste. On the contrary, recent large studies of severe major depression [7, 8] show little to no anti-depressive effects by St. John’s Wort, especially in cases of prolonged durations of depression [5]. Observational studies have shown that the rate of adverse effects caused by St. John’s Wort is nearly 10 times lower than that of synthetic antidepressants [3].
